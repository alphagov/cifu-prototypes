# Prototype version 3

Dates tested: 2022-06-10 to 2022-06-14

## Status

Superceeded by [version 4](../prototype-version-4)

## Context

> Sprint 5  
> Our first round of accessibility testing  
> Other changes we're making include preparing for civil service live (CSL) 2022 for example, radios and checkboxes

We plan to test a partial creation of a sample form as if the user has already logged into the GOV.UK Forms platform and is re-creating one of their departments existing forms.

We will also test a return journey as though they are returning to make fixes to an existing draft form.



## Admin interface screenshots

Below are the screens a form creator will see when making or editing their forms.


### GOV.UK Forms landing page

There is hint text that says, “The form name will be shown at the top of each page of the form. Use a name that describes what the form will help people to do. For example, ‘Apply for a licence’.” above a text input.

Below the text input is a green “Save and continue” button.


### Form overview page

### Edit question 1

![Edit question 1. Screenshot](screenshots/004-Edit-question-1.png)
*Page with “Question 1” caption above a heading “Edit question”.*

A secondary heading, “Question text”, comes directly before the hint text “Ask a question the way you would in person. For example ‘What is your address?’” and then a text input.

A second secondary heading, “Question short name (optional)”, followed by hint text “The short name will be used when the form’s questions are all displayed in a list. Use a short descriptive name. For example ‘Address’.” and then a text input.

Below these is a detail component, blue link with an arrow before the text, “Add hint text to help people answer the question” that is closed.

Next is a secondary heading, “What kind of answer do you need to this question?”, which has the hint text “The answer will be validated to check it’s in the selected format.” Below are radio buttons that determine the input type required:

- Single line of text, selected
- Address
- Date
- Email address
- National Insurance number
- Phone number

The page ends with a green “Save question” button, next to a grey “Create next question” button. Below the two buttons is a “Go to form overview” link.

On the right side of the screen there is a secondary heading, “Question preview” with a link to “Preview question in a new tab”.

Below the link is a smaller version of an empty GOV.UK service page within an iframe, to mimic a mobile screen. It shows the GOV.UK logo on a black header. Within the body of the page is a disabled green ‘Continue’ button.

![Edit question 1 with add hint text detail component expanded. Screenshot](screenshots/005-Edit-question-1-hint-open.png)<!-- describe expanded hint text -->
*Page with “Question 1” caption above a heading “Edit question” with detail component expanded.*

The detail component, “Add hint text to help people answer the question”, is now expanded revealing the hint text “You can use hint text if you need to explain the format the answer should be in, or where to find the information you’ve asked for.” before a text input.

Below this is an editable text area containing a provided example of what the form filler needs to agree to, “By submitting this form you are confirming that, to the best of your knowledge, the answers you are providing are correct.”  
Below the text area is a character counter, “You have 1878 characters remaining”, giving form creators an idea of how much they have left of a 2,000 character limit.

## Form runner screenshots

Below are the screens as the form filler (the end user) would see the form as they complete it.


### Preview question 1

![Preview What is your name question page. Screenshot](screenshots/101-Preview-question-1.png)
*Page with “What is your name?” question as a label for a text input. There is a green “Continue” button at the bottom.*

This page is an example of the first (and all following) question pages that a form creator has added to their form.  

The basic structure includes a “Back” link which should take the form filler to the previous page, mimicking the browser back button - in this instance it would return the user to the start page.

When the form filler clicks the “Continue” button the product should validate that an input has been given (field is not empty or radio is selected for example) before continuing through to the next question in sequence.


### Preview final question

![Preview What is your National Insurance number question page. Screenshot](screenshots/102-Preview-final-question.png)
*Page with “What is your National Insurance number?” question as a label for a text input. There is a green “Check your answers” button at the bottom.*

This page is an example of the last question in a form sequence. The difference being a green “Check your answers” button in place of the usual “Continue”.


### Preview check your answers (summary page)

![Preview check your answers page. Screenshot](screenshots/103-Preview-Check-your-answers.png)
*Page with “Check your answers” heading followed by a summary list component.*

The summary list component lists rows of the “Short version” of the questions the form creator has added with a space to the right where the form fillers answer would appear. Finally there is a “Change” link for the form filler to correct or change any answer they feel is incorrect.

Below is a secondary heading, “Declaration”, before the text “By submitting this form you are confirming that, to the best of your knowledge, the answers you are providing are correct.” This is an example declaration for the form filler to agree to, by clicking the green “Agree and submit” button. The text of the declaration is editable by the form creator within the admin side of the builder, meaning it can be customised as to the needs of the different forms or department.


### Preview form submitted (confirmation page)

![Preview form submitted page. Screenshot](screenshots/104-Preview-Form-submitted.png)
*Page with “Form submitted” heading followed by “Your reference number is HDJ2123F” in a green box.*

This page includes a secondary heading “What happens next” followed by the content “We’ve sent you an email to confirm we have received your form.” This text is editable by the form creator within the admin side of the builder, meaning it can be customised as to the needs of the different forms or department and should match their internal service level agreements (SLAs).


## What we learned

> Give a synopsis of the key findings from the round of research we tested this version.  
> Include examples of found needs, pain points or quotes to help explain the findings. These do not have to be too detailed, as this should be covered in the research findings packs/decks - which can be linked to from here.

## Opportunities (optional)

> Are there any opportunities we would like to explore, or ideas that we think we could consider?  
> List these here. They do not have to be full formulated at this point, but will inform our work (and should be added to Trello to discuss and ideate as a team).
