# Form overview page

## Context

> Give a brief overview of
> - what we wanted to test for example, user needs or design changes
> - what tasks we gave to users

For this round of testing we want to get a baseline with our first private beta partners.

We plan to test the full creation of a sample form as if the user has already logged into the GOV.UK Forms platform and is re-creating one of their departments existing forms.


## What we tested last time

<!--

> *Description of what can be seen in the screenshot, to make it easier for screen reader users and if the images do not load.*  
-->

*Page with “Form” caption above heading that says the name of the form the user entered on the “Form name” page.*

The page has a green “Add a question” button above a link to preview form.

Below preview link is a list of generated pages for check your answers and confirmation.


### What we saw

> Give a synopsis of the key findings from the round of research we tested this version.  
> Include examples of found needs, pain points or quotes to help explain the findings. These do not have to be too detailed, as this should be covered in the research findings packs/decks - which can be linked to from here.
