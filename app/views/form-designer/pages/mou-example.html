<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">GOV.UK Forms Memorandum of Understanding</h1>
<p>Last updated: 21 June 2023</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this document is</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>This is a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) between the Government Digital Service (“GDS”) and your organisation (together the “Parties”). The single MOU covers all the forms an organisation publishes using GOV.UK Forms.</li>
  <li>This MOU shall be interpreted in accordance with the Annexes.</li>
  <li>This MOU is not intended to be legally binding and no legal obligations or legal rights shall arise between the Parties from the provisions of the MOU. For the avoidance of doubt, GDS shall not be liable for any Loss arising from, or in connection with a breach of this MOU. However, the Parties enter into the MOU intending to honour their obligations. Any dispute will be escalated to appropriately senior officers of GDS and your organisation for resolution.</li>
  <li>Organisations who are temporarily having their forms created by GDS (from July to October 2023) will not immediately have accounts on GOV.UK Forms. For these organisations, any parts of the MOU that relate to accessing the product, or creating forms or accounts, will not apply until your organisation has accounts set up. From that point, all of the MOU will apply (as per paragraph 10).</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About GOV.UK Forms</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="5">
  <li>GOV.UK Forms is a web-based platform owned and operated by GDS, which is used for creating more accessible online forms for GOV.UK without needing technical knowledge. As well as the forms being more accessible compared to document-based forms like PDFs, the forms are easier to use and quicker for government teams to process.</li>
  <li>When your organisation creates online forms, at your request, GOV.UK Forms collects information from members of the public and businesses. As GOV.UK Forms processes the Personal Data from members of the public and businesses on behalf of your organisation, GDS is a Data Processor for your organisation.</li>
  <li>When GOV.UK Forms processes completed forms, GDS sends the Personal Data of members of the public and businesses to your organisation. GDS uses GOV.UK Notify to deliver emails with the personal data submissions to your organisation's Form Processors. This MOU covers this transfer.</li>
  <li>The online forms are unauthenticated and could be completed by anyone. You are responsible for including identification and authentication mechanisms within your downstream processes if these are required.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How GOV.UK Forms handles the personal data of members of the public and businesses  </h2>

</figure>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="9">
<li>
  The GOV.UK Forms team designs and develops the GOV.UK Forms web platform. Your organisation gets access to and creates online forms using the GOV.UK Forms platform. Your organisation’s form creators create online forms using the GOV.UK Forms platform, which runs on an external cloud service. Members of the public and businesses fill in a form on GOV.UK Forms. GOV.UK Forms collects the Personal Data and uses an API to deliver the Personal Data to GOV.UK Notify. GOV.UK Notify, using an external email provider, delivers the personal data to your organisation’s shared inbox for your Form Processor to use.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Starting and ending this agreement</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="10">
<li>This agreement starts when your organisation has user accounts on the GOV.UK Forms platform. Either GDS or your organisation can end this agreement by giving three months’ notice by email.</li>
<li>Any updates to this agreement will be emailed to the person who agreed on behalf of your organisation (or the first account in your organisation that is still active). This will happen 30 calendar days before any change is due to be made, along with a summary of the changes. The changes will then take effect on the date specified in the notification email. No action is required by your organisation if you accept the changes.</li>
<li>If your organisation doesn’t wish to accept the change, you must notify GDS and this MOU will terminate with immediate effect.</li>
<li>Some organisations will not immediately have accounts on GOV.UK Forms as they’re temporarily having their forms created by GDS (from July to October 2023). For these organisations:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>this agreement starts when your organisation agrees to the MOU, and forms will not be made by GDS before this point</li>
    <li>if there are any issues with transferring these forms to an organisation, GDS reserves the right to delete the forms from the platform and have them removed from GOV.UK. This MOU will then terminate with immediate effect.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">People involved in this agreement</h2>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="14">
  <li>For this agreement, the main point of contact for GDS is: govuk-forms-support@govuk.zendesk.com</li>
  <li>For your organisation, the main point of contact will be the person named when agreeing on behalf of your organisation.</li>
  <li>The GOV.UK Forms team will both supervise and process personal data within GDS.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">GOV.UK Forms pricing</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="17">
<li>There is currently no cost for using GOV.UK Forms or for the hosting of forms made on the platform. This is intended to help reduce the barriers to lower volume services using GOV.UK Forms that would otherwise require significant procurement effort. This will help drive greater digitisation of government services and promote channel shift, saving money and time for our users.</li>
<li>If this pricing structure should change in the future, GDS will inform your organisation at least six months before any price changes so that you can decide whether to continue using the product. </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Cyber Security Responsibilities</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="19">
  <li>You are responsible for deciding whether or not GOV.UK Forms is suitable to handle the information you wish to collect using online forms. A description of the measures GDS has taken to protect data is described in Annex E.</li>
  <li>You shall ensure that your users of GOV.UK Forms enable MFA (known as “2SV” or “2 step verification”) on their GOV.UK Signon user accounts.</li>
  <li>
    You shall ensure that your users of GOV.UK Forms follow good cyber security practices when accessing the service, to include:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>using end-user devices that are being managed in accordance with the requirements of the Minimum Cyber Security Standard (and its successor standards)</li>
      <li>not connecting their end-user devices to untrusted WiFi networks, such as those found in public places like cafes and hotels</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If it is suspected that a user’s GOV.UK Signon account has been compromised you shall immediately notify the GOV.UK Forms team. </li>
  <li>You shall ensure that the GOV.UK Forms team is promptly notified when a user in your organisation no longer requires access to the Forms administration interface.</li>
  <li>
    You are responsible for managing the security of the mail server you will use to receive form responses. Before using GOV.UK Forms you must ensure that this meets the government secure email policy, including:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>supporting Transport Layer Security Version 1.2 (TLS v1.2) or later[1]</li>
      <li>implementing spam and malware filtering</li>
      <li>enforcing DMARC on inbound email Note: The NCSC’s Mail Check service can be used for assessing email security compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You are responsible for managing the security of the designated mailbox(es) used to receive form response data. Anyone with access to the mailbox(es) will potentially be able to see the form response data. </li>
  <li>You may want to consider implementing rules on your mail server to restrict who / what can send emails to the mailbox. For example, you could only allow messages originating from the Notify service to be accepted. </li>
  <li>You should also bear in mind that email addresses provided by users (in a submission) have not been validated, so may not be correct addresses. Notify emails from GOV.UK Forms can also not be replied to.</li>
  <li>Parties should report any messages received by this mailbox that are outside of the email output expected from the GOV.UK Forms service (e.g. incorrect content format, incorrect sender or bulk messages sent through the service), to the GOV.UK Forms team (see contact at item 23).</li>
  <li>You are responsible for checking that form response data received from GOV.UK Forms is safe before you consume it.</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Annex D: GOV.UK Forms schedule of processing, personal data and data subjects</h2>

<p>Annex D provides a general description of how GOV.UK Forms will process Personal Data on behalf of your organisation as controller. The Annex will be supplemented by the content of the forms your organisation creates using the GOV.UK Forms platform, and this content will constitute your further documented instructions as to how GDS may process personal data on your behalf for the purposes of Article 28(3)(a) of UK GDPR.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Subject matter of the Processing</h3>
<p>To support the running of government services, GOV.UK Forms collects Personal and Non-Personal Data from members of the public and businesses so that your organisation can make decisions about them.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Duration of the Processing</h3>
<p>Processing is typically complete within 7 days, however there is a potential for your organisation to request that GDS retains their data for up to 90 days (see data retention periods above).</p>

<p>Third party suppliers that distribute the notifications for GOV.UK Notify will retain the data for up to 12 months for audit and billing purposes.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Nature and purposes of the Processing</h3>

<p>GOV.UK Forms collects Personal Data for the purposes of Processing forms that are submitted by members of the public and businesses.</p>

<p>GOV.UK Forms also collects Personal Data for the purposes of monitoring and alerting on application performance and platform security.</p>

<p>GOV.UK Forms uses third party suppliers to deliver emails to your organisation and to manage customer support.</p>

<p>Once the relevant retention period has been reached, GOV.UK Forms Personal Data is deleted by GDS and third party suppliers.</p>

<p>The purposes of government forms are many and varied, but generally fall into the categories of licences, permits, registrations, reporting, taxation, refunds, requesting support, renewals, records changes, exemptions, appeals, correspondence, public engagement and procurement.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Types of Personal Data</h3>

<p>The types of Personal Data collected in government forms will be dependent on the form that has been provided, but generally will include name, identification number, location data and other data that could identify an individual both directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Where needed for the service, forms may also collect special category data and information relating to criminal convictions and offences.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Categories of Data Subject</h3>

<p>Includes members of the public and people employed by businesses or other organisations.</p>

<p>Plan for return or destruction of the data once the Processing is complete, unless required under union or member state Law to preserve that type of data</p>

<p>Personal Data is automatically deleted at the end of the data retention period, which for GOV.UK Forms and its third party providers ranges between 7 days and 2 years (see data retention periods above). This is the case as part of routine Processing, and at termination of this Agreement.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Annex E: How GOV.UK Forms protects your data</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the security measures provided by the GOV.UK Forms service. It is intended to assist you with deciding whether the service is suitable for your needs.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Hosting</h3>
<p>GOV.UK Forms is hosted on GOV.UK PaaS, a fully managed AWS-based platform that is operated by GDS and utilises data centres located in Dublin and London.</p> 

<p>GOV.UK PaaS was designed to implement the NCSC’s Cloud Security Principles and to meet the common security needs when handling information classified as OFFICIAL.</p> 

<p>GOV.UK PaaS has an availability target of 99.05%.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Service design</h3>
<p>GOV.UK Forms has been designed to align with government cyber security standards, including the Minimum Cyber Security Standard, the Service Standard and relevant guidance published by the NCSC, the UK’s national authority for cyber security.</p>

<p>Threat modelling and risk assessments are used to identify where additional security measures may be necessary.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Target service availability </h3>
<p>GDS’s Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for GOV.UK Forms [the target maximum length of time it should take to restore normal operations following an outage or data loss], is two working days, plus any time it takes to restore external services that have caused the issue.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Backup and recovery</h3>
<p>GDS’ Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for GOV.UK Forms [the target maximum time from any event to which forms created using the service can be restored], is two working days, plus any time it takes to restore external services that have caused the issue.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Personnel security controls</h3>
<p>Operations staff within GDS and its supply chain who support GOV.UK Forms are required to successfully complete pre-employment screening in accordance with the Baseline Personnel Security Standard or an equivalent commercial screening process.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Separation between customers</h3>
<p>Organisations can only create and edit their own forms.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Use of Notify</h3>
<p>GOV.UK Forms uses the GOV.UK Notify service to deliver form response data to your organisation via email messages.</p> 

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Protection of data in transit</h3>
<p>Within GOV.UK Forms, form response data will be encrypted in transit as follows:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Between citizens’ browsers and online forms, by using TLS V1.2</li>
  <li>Between your users’ browsers and the GOV.UK Forms administration interface, by using TLS V1.2</li>
  <li>Between GOV.UK Forms and its 3rd party processors, by using TLS V1.2</li>
  <li>Between Notify and your designated mailbox for receiving submitted form responses, by using TLS V1.2 if your mail server supports this </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Protection of data at rest</h3>
<p>Form response data will be encrypted at rest using AWS At-Rest Encryption in ElastiCache for Redis whilst it is being temporarily stored by GOV.UK Forms.</p>

<p>Amazon RDS PostgreSQL is used to store form configuration and user account details. The PaaS PostgreSQL plans have encryption at rest.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Vulnerability management</h3>
<p>Software code is subject to security testing during the software development process and the production environment is subject to continuous vulnerability scanning using NCSC’s Web Check.</p>

<p>The service is subject to independent penetration testing at least annually and prior to major functional feature releases. Any findings are risk assessed and managed in accordance with GDS’s risk appetite.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Event logging and protective monitoring</h3>
<p>GDS generates and retains event logs of the systems and applications that deliver GOV.UK Forms and the service is protectively monitored for indicators of compromise.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Governance</h3>
<p>During its development, GOV.UK Forms was subject to independent service assessments. In addition, GDS Information Assurance maintains an independent information risk assessment of the service, reporting to the GDS Senior Leadership Team.</p> 
________________
[1] If your mail server does not support the use of TLS, form response data could be transmitted in plain text across the Internet.
