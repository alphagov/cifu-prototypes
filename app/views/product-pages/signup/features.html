    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How GOV.UK Forms works</h1>
    <p>
      GOV.UK Forms is a new platform that makes it easy to create accessible online
      forms for GOV.UK. It’s currently in development with selected government
      partners.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-inset-text">
      If you’re interested in using GOV.UK Forms, you can
      <a
        href="subscribe"
        >register to get a notification when it's available</a
      >
      for all of central government.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Creating a form using GOV.UK Forms</h2>

    <p>
      You need to be given access to GOV.UK Forms to use it. In this early stage of
      development, we’re only working with a limited number of government teams.
    </p>

    <p>These are the steps to make a form with GOV.UK Forms.</p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>Create a form and give the form a name.</li>
      <li>Add questions to your form to collect the information you need.</li>
      <li>
        Provide privacy information, the email address you want completed forms to
        be sent to, and details about what will happen after a form is submitted.
      </li>
      <li>Make the form live.</li>
      <li>
        Publish a link to the form on GOV.UK along with any guidance people need to
        read before they complete the form.
      </li>
      <li>
        When people complete and submit the form, the information they enter will be
        sent in the body of an email to the email address you specified.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features available now</h2>
    <p>
      During this early phase of development, we’re focusing on the simplest and
      most commonly needed form features first.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Create questions</h3>

    <p>You can create questions to ask for:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a person’s name</li>
      <li>an organisation’s name</li>
      <li>a phone number</li>
      <li>an email address</li>
      <li>a UK or international address</li>
      <li>a National Insurance number</li>
      <li>a date</li>
      <li>a number</li>
      <li>a selection of one or more answers from a list of options</li>
      <li>a short or long text answer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can also:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>add a hint to a question to help people answer it</li>
      <li>make a question optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Help people answer questions accurately and easily
    </h3>

    <p>
      When people complete a form, their responses will be validated to make sure
      they’re in the correct format. For example, a question asking for an email address will only accept an answer in the format of an email address. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For questions that ask for certain types of personal information (such as a name, address or date of birth) the input field will be encoded so people can use their browser or assistive technology to answer more easily. For example, by completing the field with information saved in their browser.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Skip questions based on a response
    </h3>

    <p>
      With a question route, you can skip someone to a later question in your form based on 
      their response to a question where they have to select one answer from a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you could ask someone a Yes/No question about something and only ask further 
      questions about that thing if they select ‘Yes’. Anyone who answers ‘No’ will be skipped 
      forward to the next question that’s relevant for them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Forms use GOV.UK Design System styles, components and patterns
    </h3>

    <p>
      Using these tested and accessible designs means you do not have to worry about
      the visual and interface design of your forms. And they’ll automatically look
      consistent with GOV.UK.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Provide privacy information</h3>

    <p>
      To comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you’ll
      need to provide a link to privacy information for the people who’ll enter
      their data into your form.
    </p>

    <p>
      The privacy information needs to include your purposes for collecting the
      data, and how you'll manage the data. You may already publish this
      information, for example in a privacy notice or personal information charter.
    </p>

    <p>
      A link to the privacy information will be added to the footer of your form.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Set the email address for completed forms</h3>

    <p>
      Each form needs an email address to be set for completed forms to be sent to
      when they’re submitted. Data from completed forms will be sent to this email
      address in the body of an email.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      People can check their answers before they submit a form
    </h3>

    <p>
      People will be shown a summary page when they have answered all the questions
      in a form. They will be able to review and check their answers before they
      submit the form. This will help to avoid errors or missing information.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Add a declaration for people to agree to
    </h3>

    <p>
      You can add a declaration that people must confirm they understand and agree to before they submit their completed form. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You might want to add a declaration if, for example, you need people to confirm they have provided accurate information, or that they understand the consequences of providing false information.
    </p>  

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Tell people what will happen next</h3>

    <p>
      Content you add about what will happen after the form is submitted will be
      shown on a confirmation page when someone submits a form. This will help to
      set their expectations and avoid unnecessary contact.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Provide contact information for people to get help
    </h3>

    <p>
      You must provide at least one way for people to get help if they get stuck
      while filling in your form. It can be an email address, phone number or a link
      to online help.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contact information will be displayed at the bottom of every page of the
      form. This will help people to use your form successfully, and will let you
      know if there are any problems with your form.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Prepare changes to a live form in a draft
    </h3>

    <p>
      You can make a draft version of a live form so you can prepare changes to it. This means you can share the new draft for review before you make the changes live. It also minimises disruption to people who might be filling in the form when you update it. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Features we’re working on next</h2>

    <p>These are the features we’re working on now and next:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>User management and permissions to control what users can and cannot do</li>
      <li>Adding longer guidance for more complex questions</li>
      <li>Asking a question multiple times - for example to collect a history of home addresses</li>
      <li>The ability for people to create an account and trial the product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Updates</h2>

    <p>
      We’re still in the early stages of development so our plans may change. We’ll
      update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.
    </p>
