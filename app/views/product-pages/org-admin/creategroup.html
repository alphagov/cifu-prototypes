      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Create a new group for forms</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Each form needs to be created in a ‘group’. Once you have a group, you can add other people to create and edit forms in it.
      </p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        When a group is first created it will be a ‘trial’ group. That means you cannot make any forms in the group live. You’ll be able to request for a group to be upgraded to an ‘active’ group if you need to make forms live.
      </div>

      <p class="govuk-body">Give your group a meaningful name that will reflect the forms you’ll create in the group, and make sense to the people that will be added to it. For example:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Licensing forms</li>
        <li>GOV.UK content team</li>
        <li>Juggling service forms</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can change the name later if you need to.</p>
