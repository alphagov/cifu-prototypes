      <p>
        A basic form page designer with the following features:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you create one page at a time, using a looping wizard interface</li>
        <li>pages are designed via a form, rather than directly edited them</li>
        <li>there's a persistent mobile-sized preview pane on most pages</li>
        <li>the preview pane is functional, so you can use it to navigate the form</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The prototype explores how we can usefully constrain the the space of possible
        page designs to those that follow the GOV.UK Design System.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also explores the hypothesis that a persistent preview pane provides reassurance,
        and helps users learn how the UI relates to the finished form.
